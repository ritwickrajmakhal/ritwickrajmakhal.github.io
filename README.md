Many portfolio websites lack engaging and interactive elements, hindering effective communication of the creator's skills and achievements to visitors. This limits the ability to make a strong impression and provide personalized responses to visitors' inquiries, ultimately impacting user engagement.

Our project seeks to solve this issue by leveraging Microsoft Azure services to develop an interactive chatbot. This chatbot aims to enhance user engagement on portfolio websites by providing real-time assistance.

By utilizing AI-driven conversation capabilities, the chatbot will answer queries, highlight portfolio achievements, and seamlessly guide users through the content.

By addressing the problem of static portfolio websites, our chatbot empowers portfolio owners to connect more effectively with their audience, leave a lasting impression, and showcase their work and expertise in a captivating manner.
